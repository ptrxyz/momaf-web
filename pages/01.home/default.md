# Science Data Center for Molecular Material Research 

The Science Data Center for Molecular Materials Research (MoMaF) supports research and data management in scientific disciplines ranging from molecular chemistry to materials science.

Long-term preservation and reuse of research data are currently not systematically organized in these disciplines, and unique solutions of individual working groups lead to low availability and visibility of research results.

One goal of the project is the development of a platform for electronic laboratory notebooks that can be used by scientists from different disciplines to collect research data in a structured manner, supporting researchers in all phases of the research process.

Another project goal is the implementation of the [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples?target=_blank) by developing subject-specific, internationally visible repositories.
